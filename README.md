# IDZPrecompiledTheora [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iosdevzone/IDZPrecompiledTheora.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iosdevzone/IDZPrecompiledTheora)

libtheora compiled for iOS armv7, armv7s, arm64, i386 and x86_64

This is a first attempt to get libtheora to compile, in response to a blog reader's request. The compilation was successful but the results are COMPLETELY UNTESTED. Use at your own risk.
